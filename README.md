# WCLT Roadmap

WCLT is currently my focus, with the following items on the roadmap:

1 - Using a MYSQL database, moving away from files to a database system, this will help further tasks down the line.

2 - Flask App and interface for team management, a flask app will allow for multiplayer gameplay and using HTML to handle managing the teams in the database.

3 - League customization - Seperating League and Competition mangement will allow for more customization and control for comissioners.

4 - Better scouting/minor league system, implameneted to improve what it means to manage a team.

5 - Graphical game display and logs - Logging the game in such a way that it can be "replayed" graphically, as well as allowing matches to play graphically live will increase player engagement.

6 - Change the dice roll system to remove decimals (make it a D1000 vs a D100 and apply modifiers accordingly)
