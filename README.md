l33t is a social deduction game about aristocrats in a Cyberpunk world, players must deduce the intentions of others and make sure they are on the winning side when the dust settles.  Currently, this game is on the backburner.

World Championship Laser Tag puts players in the role of the GM of a Laser Tag team in the 1980s, but also the future.  You manage your roster and tactics to build the best possible strategy to defeat your opponents in asychrnonus matches.



# WCLT Roadmap

WCLT is currently my focus, with the following items on the roadmap:

1 - Changing the game play to the 3 tactic system (instead of choosing tactics based on winning and losing), this should make planning more interesting and games more dynamic, helping the players do their best.  This is currently in works on another branch.

2 - Using a MYSQL database, moving away from files to a database system, this will help further tasks down the line.

3 - Flask App and interface for team management, a flask app will allow for multiplayer gameplay and using HTML to handle managing the teams in the database.

4 - League customization - Seperating League and Competition mangement will allow for more customization and control for comissioners.

5 - Better scouting/minor league system, implameneted to improve what it means to manage a team.

6 - Graphical game display and logs - Logging the game in such a way that it can be "replayed" graphically, as well as allowing matches to play graphically live will increase player engagement.
